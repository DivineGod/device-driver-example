# Touch Driver Example firmware

This example firmware uses the driver we created as an example of using the
[`device-driver` crate](https://crates.io/crates/device-driver)

It's also using a custom Board Support Crate (also known as BSP/board support package) for the waveshare rp2040
touch lcd 1.28inch board.
